==== PHY API Restructured

In this release, the code has been restructured to allow separate release of the PHY API (MEPA). This following has been done:

* VSC PHY implementation moved from base/phy to mepa/vtss/src.
* VSC PHY header files moved from include to mepa/vtss/include.
* MESA PHY header files moved from mesa/include/ethernet/switch/api to mepa/vtss/include/microchip/switch/api.
* VSC PHY compile-time options:
** VTSS_OPT_PHY_1G: 1G PHYs, default included.
** VTSS_OPT_PHY_10G: 10G PHYs, default excluded.
** VTSS_OPT_PHY_TIMESTAMP: Timestamping, default excluded.
** VTSS_OPT_PHY_MACSEC: MacSec, default excluded.
** VTSS_OPT_PHY_PORT_COUNT: Port count, default 64.
** VTSS_OPT_PHY_TRACE: Trace, default included.

For switch applications, it is recommended to control the PHYs using MEBA:

* MEPA drivers are installed using meba_phy_driver_init().
* PHY control is then done using meba_phy_*() functions.
